# Serial-Generator
Serial Generator is a Windows console application designed to generate and validate serial keys.

# How To Use
1. Type **"g"** and enter to select the **(g)enerate** option
2. Next, specify the number of serials you wish to be generated
3. Alternatively you can type **"v"** and enter to select the **(v)alidate** option
4. Type or paste the serial you wish to validate, the console will either print **Valid** if the serial is leigitmate or **Invalid** if it is not

# Disclaimer
This code is older than I would like it to be and must be improved. These projects are simply being pushed to GitHub in the event of storage failure. The code will be revisited and much improved in the future (most likely in C++).
